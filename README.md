# k8n-kubernetes-util-ops
Python utility scripts to list kubernetes objects for more practical purposes.

This repository is a collection of some python scripts which runs against the kubernetes cluster or namespace to list/get meaningful data which you can use for operations or in release notes or other purposes. Sometimes just kubectl commands are not enough however or they do not group or view information in the way it can be presentable. Hence!
